# Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows Download PC Game Full Version

Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows is set in 16th-century Japan, more precisely in the second half of the Sengoku period (approx. 1467‚Äì1573). It was a time of constant internal conflicts, clan wars, and political intrigues that eventually led to the gradual unification of the country. Towards the end of this period, historical figures such as Oda Nobunaga, Ujimasa, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi also appeared, who played a key role in consolidating power and transforming Japan into a unified feudal state.

## Assassin's Creed Shadows Story Introduction

The reviewed **Assassin's Creed Shadows free download** begins with the introduction of the characters. Yasuke appears in mysterious circumstances in Japan together with Portuguese representatives who have a certain matter for Oda Nobunaga - one of the greatest Japanese leaders. During the discussion, he discovers that the black hero is not an ordinary slave, and that there is great potential in his mind. He receives a unique, life-changing opportunity.

Then we smoothly move on to Naoe, the second main character of the latest installment of Assassin's Creed. She witnesses Oda Nobunaga's attack on her province of Igi, where blood is spurting at every step. Many important people are killed - not only for Naoe and Yasuke, but also their allies, both old and future.

## Lots of main threads - no boredom

In fact, **Assassin's Creed Shadows download pc** tells at least 4 important main plots that complement each other perfectly - however, it is worth bearing in mind that not all of them last until the elimination of the "head of a member of the enemy organization", because some end in the first act, and others after the action mentioned a few words earlier - Yasuke and Naoe have their own stories to close, which allows you to learn about individual events from their perspective in an interesting way. And honestly, in many places they are more interesting than the story related to the Order.

While exploring Japan, we meet a lot of people who had contact with Naoe or Yasuke in the past. By interacting with them, we learn more about the characters we control - these are not just dialogues that we will easily forget, but often completely separate missions that take us back to the past. We see how Yasuke lived when he was already in Japan, what he faced even earlier, and we also see what Naoe has had to face since childhood, as well as how many secrets her loved ones have kept from her. These threads need to be wrapped up to the very end, because they contain a lot of references to older installments of the series.

## Assassin's Creed Shadows did its job!

To sum up - the reviewed **Assassin's Creed Shadows torrent** turned out to be a decent production. I dare say that it was one of the better ones, if we take into account the last parts of the series, such as Syndicate, Unity, Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, Mirage. Ubisoft introduced a lot of changes and most of them fulfilled their role. I have a big objection to the neglect of the modern thread (or rather treating it stepmotherly), which had huge potential after the events with Layla Hassan and Basim in AC Valhalla. Heck, AC Mirage itself was supposed to prepare us for something bigger, and here such a flop. There was also a lack of larger, memorable battles between clans/families despite having Yasuke in its ranks. And this ending related to the group we are chasing - is not satisfying.

However, the main characters' storylines, the completely different gameplay experience after switching between characters, the fewer optional activities, the exploration that didn't take us to empty areas and forced us to stick to the main roads, and the incredibly impressive Japan, the combat that adapted to our skills, and the seasons that made the area we had already visited look completely different... it all strongly encouraged us to continue playing and discovering secrets.

**Is Assassin's Creed Shadows still coming out?**
Shadows was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox Series X/S and macOS on March 20, 2025, with a version for iPadOS to be released at a later date.

**Is Assassin's Creed Shadows like Mirage?**
Assassin's Creed Mirage, the last tile, was much more similar to older titles in the series. Thus, it also received acclaim from series veterans. However, Shadows seems to be returning to the franchise's formula, which includes RPG elements and a massive playable map to facilitate the same.
